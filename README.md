# Missing data and multiple imputation

This reporistory contains scripts for multiple imputation including explanations.

Most important is the [R-markdown on Multivariable imputation of missing data](https://rjverheijden.github.io/missing_data/R-Markdown-Multivariable-Missings-Imputation-Example-2022-06-27.html).

These scripts and explanations were compiled based on (but not affiliated with) the one-week course on Missing Data course as part of the [MSC Epidemiology](https://www.msc-epidemiology.nl/phd.html), several books, scientific articles, and R-vignettes.

> [!WARNING]
> These scripts and explanations are not regularly updated and may not be best suited for your project. Check for most recent advancements in the field and package updates prior to use and consult an expert if needed.
