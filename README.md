# Missing data and multiple imputation

This reporistory contains scripts for multiple imputation including explanations.

Most important is the [R-markdown on Multivariable imputation of missing data](https://rjverheijden.github.io/missing_data/R-Markdown-Multivariable-Missings-Imputation-Example-2022-06-27.html).

These scripts and explanations were compiled based on (but not affiliated with) the Missing Data course as part of the [MSC Epidemiology](https://www.msc-epidemiology.nl/phd.html), several books and R vignettes.
