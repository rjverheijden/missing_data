# Missing data and multiple imputation

This reporistory contains scripts for multiple imputation including explanations.

Most important is the [R-markdown on Multivariable imputation of missing data](https://rjverheijden.github.io/missing_data/R-Markdown-Multivariable-Missings-Imputation-Example-2022-06-27.html).
The [PowerPoint](https://github.com/rjverheijden/missing_data/raw/refs/heads/main/Presentation%20research%20meeting%20melanoma%202022-06-28%20Missing%20data%20and%20multiple%20imputation.pptx) can be downloaded by clicking on [`View raw`](https://github.com/rjverheijden/missing_data/raw/refs/heads/main/Presentation%20research%20meeting%20melanoma%202022-06-28%20Missing%20data%20and%20multiple%20imputation.pptx).

These scripts and explanations were compiled based on (but not affiliated with) the one-week course on Missing Data course as part of the [MSC Epidemiology](https://www.msc-epidemiology.nl/phd.html), several books, scientific articles, and R-vignettes.
